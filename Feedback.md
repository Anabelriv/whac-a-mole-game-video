This is the python part of the review for Aleksei and Anabel's project 'Game Store'. 

### Points for Improvement:
1. **Consistency in Naming**: Class names like `Infomatoin` appear to be misspelled. This should be corrected for better readability.
2. **Comment Clarity**: The code snippet `# Create your models here.` appears after some models have already been declared. This can be confusing.
3. **Password Security**: Storing passwords in plain text under the `Infomatoin` model is a major security risk. Consider using Django's built-in authentication system or at least hashing the passwords.
4. **Error Handling**: In the `view_profile` function, you fetch the `GameProfile` directly without handling the case where it might not exist. This could result in a server error.
5. **Imports**: Imports like `from .models import *` are not recommended as it makes it unclear which classes or functions are being used from the module.
6. **DRY Code**: Both `sign_in` and `sign_out` have redundant code when it comes to rendering forms. Consider making this DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

### Points for Preservation:
1. **Indentation and Formatting**: Overall, the code is well-formatted and adheres to PEP 8 standards. This is a good practice.
2. **Use of Django Features**: Good use of Django's ORM, authentication decorators, and other features. It shows a good grasp of the framework.
3. **Modularity**: Functions are well-segregated, and it's clear what each one is supposed to do. The use of signals for creating a game profile is a nice touch.
4. **User Feedback**: Using `messages.success` and `messages.error` to display feedback is a good UX practice.

Overall, Aleksei and Anabel have done a commendable job. However, there are some areas that could be improved. Keep up the good work!

Yossi.
